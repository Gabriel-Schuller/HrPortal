## About this solution

This is a minimalist, non-layered startup solution with the ABP Framework. All the fundamental ABP modules are already installed.

## How to run

The application needs to a database. Run the following command in the `HrPortal` directory:

````bash
dotnet run --migrate-database
````

This will create and seed the initial database. Then you can run the application with any IDE that supports .NET.

Happy coding..!

## How to deploy on docker
The application provides the related *Dockerfiles* and *docker-compose* file with scripts. You can build the docker images and run them using docker-compose. The necessary database, DbMigrator, and the application will be running on docker with health checks in an isolated docker network.

### Creating the docker images
Navigate to _etc/build_ folder and run the `build-images-locally.ps1` script. You can examine the script to set **image tag** for your images. It is `latest` by default.

### Running the docker images using docker-compose
Navigate to _etc/docker_ folder and run the `run-docker.ps1` script. The script will generate developer certificates (if it doesn't exist already) with `dotnet dev-certs` command to use HTTPS. Then, the script runs the provided docker-compose file on detached mode.

> Not: Developer certificate is only valid for **localhost** domain. If you want to deploy to a real DNS in a production environment, use LetsEncrypt or similar tools.
